Implemented Linear regression, Navie Bayes, Random forest algorithm to detect price of second hand car on 6000 data of diffrent cars.
### Libraries Used
Libraries used in this project are as follows:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
  
## Installation Setup

#### 1. Clone the repository
You can clone this repository using command: ``git clone https://github.com/Jimmy5467/Second-hand-car-price-prediction.git``
#### 2. Open ``Car_value_kaggle.ipynb``
You can open the ``.ipynb`` file using [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook <br>
Don't have **Jupyter Notebook**? Don't worry, run the following commands and you're good to go ðŸš€ <br>
> **$ pip install notebook** <br>
> **$ jupyter notebook**
#### 3. Execute all the cells consecutively to see the accurecy of all model and the graphical reprentaion of the data.
#### 4. After fireing the queries, at the end of all the algorithms we will get the price of the selected car.
  
## Results
The least square method was used to estimate the model, and the following Minitab results were obtained.
R - Square Value | Accuracy
------------ | -------------
Linear Regression | 83.67%
NaÃ¯ve Bayes | 88.68%
Random Forest | 89.01%

The percentage answer variance in a variable called R-square is explained by a linear model (Rsq). This means that a high R-square value indicates that the model is more suited to the data and hence produces more reliable results.
